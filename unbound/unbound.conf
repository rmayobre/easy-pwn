    # File  with  trust  anchor  for  one  zone, which is tracked with
    # RFC5011 probes.  The probes are run  several  times  per  month,
    # thus  the  machine  must be online frequently.  The initial file
    # can be one with contents as described in trust-anchor-file.  The
    # file  is  written  to when the anchor is updated, so the unbound
    # user must have write permission.  Write permission to the  file,
    # but  also to the directory it is in (to create a temporary file,
    # which is necessary to deal with filesystem full events), it must
    # also be inside the chroot (if that is used).
    auto-trust-anchor-file: "var/root.key"

    # If  null or "", no file is used.  Set it to the certificate bun-
    # dle file, for example "/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt".  These
    # certificates  are  used  for  authenticating connections made to
    # outside peers.  For example auth-zone urls, and  also  DNS  over
    # TLS  connections.  It is read at start up before permission drop
    # and chroot.

    # Harden against algorithm downgrade when multiple algorithms  are
    # advertised  in  the  DS record.  If no, allows the weakest algo-
    # rithm to validate the zone.  Default is no.  Zone  signers  must
    # produce  zones  that  allow  this feature to work, but sometimes
    # they do not, and turning this option off avoids that  validation
    # failure.

    # From RFC 8020 (with title "NXDOMAIN: There Really Is Nothing Un-
    # derneath"), returns nxdomain to queries for a name below another
    # name that is already known to be nxdomain.  DNSSEC mandates  no-
    # error  for empty nonterminals, hence this is possible.  Very old
    # software might return nxdomain for empty nonterminals (that usu-
    # ally happen for reverse IP address lookups), and thus may be in-
    # compatible with this.  To try to avoid this  only  DNSSEC-secure
    # nxdomains  are  used,  because  the  old  software does not have
    # DNSSEC.  Default is yes.  The  nxdomain  must  be  secure,  this
    # means nsec3 with optout is insufficient.
    harden-below-nxdomain: yes

    # Require DNSSEC data for trust-anchored zones, if  such  data  is
    # absent,  the  zone  becomes  bogus. If turned off, and no DNSSEC
    # data is received (or the DNSKEY data fails  to  validate),  then
    # the  zone  is made insecure, this behaves like there is no trust
    # anchor. You could turn this off if you are sometimes  behind  an
    # intrusive  firewall (of some sort) that removes DNSSEC data from
    # packets, or a zone changes from  signed  to  unsigned  to  badly
    # signed  often. If turned off you run the risk of a downgrade at-
    # tack that disables security for a zone. Default is yes.
    harden-dnssec-stripped: yes

    # Will trust glue only if it is within the servers authority. De-
    # fault is yes.

    # Very  large queries are ignored. Default is off, since it is le-

    # eration if TSIG or EDNS payload is very large.

    # Very small EDNS buffer sizes from queries are  ignored.  Default
    # is on, as described in the standard.

    # PERFORMANCE

    # If set, a total number of unwanted replies is kept track  of  in
    # every thread.  When it reaches the threshold, a defensive action
    # is taken and a warning is printed to the log.  The defensive ac-
    # tion  is to clear the rrset and message caches, hopefully flush-
    # ing away any poison.  A value of 10 million is  suggested.   De-
    # fault is 0 (turned off).
